#Configuration
Send SMS every SLPNG seconds and go to sleep. SMS massage contains is date and hour + RTC temperature + Battery voltage
  
  The code uses Stalker + GPRSBee
  
  
  Stalker:
    Jumper INT PD2 welded in Stalker to Use Interruption with RTC
    Jumper PD5-En welded in Stalker to swtich on and off bee power
    Cable from Bee port #9 to GPRSBEE_PWRPIN. The GPRSbee uses DTR pin (pin 9)  for software ON/OFF. Switching on or off is simply a matter of momentarily switching DTR high.
   Cable from bee port 12 to XBEECTS_PIN. The CTS pin (pin 12) is used for power status.If the CTS pin is high the GPRSbee is on, if it is low itâ€™s off.
   
   Cable CTS and PWRPin from GPRSBee to Stalker In pins
  
  GPRSBEE_PWRPIN (Stalker) <--> pin#9 (GPRSBee)
  
  XBEECTS_PIN    (Stalker) <--> pin#12 (GPRSBee)
  
  Port0 (Stalker) <--> pin#1 (GPRSBee) Tx
  
  Port1 (Stalker) <--> pin#2 (GPRSBee) Rx
    
  
  
  To read from serial monitor in the computer, in Diag.h #define enable_diag 1 otherwise #undef. Define wich ports are going to be used with serial monitor RX/TX DIAGPORT_TX/DIAGPORT_RX
  
  #define ENABLE_DIAG     1
  
  UartSBee Gnd <--> Gnd Stalker
  
  UartSBee Rx <--> DIAGPORT_TX Stalker
  
  UartSBee TX <--> DIAGPORT_RX Stalker
  
  To program Stalker unconnect pin0 and 1 or take gprsbee out. (sharing ports 0 and 1 from Stalker)
